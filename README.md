## 1. Introduction

Email has been around for over 50 years, and has become an key part of our modern-day lives. But whilst it introduced communication to the masses, it has a lot of problems - spam, clutter, and generally it is messy. There have been many attempts to change email - productivity apps such as Spark, Superhuman, Newton, as well as larger-scale attempts to completely change email such as ProtonMail and HEY. But whilst these have worked in part, they have never really fundamentally changed email - there has never been an Email 2.0. Why? For several reasons - one; they are mostly closed-source, and HEY especially is very much only beneficial to those willing to pay for the service. Two; it's messy. Fundamentally changing something everyone uses - incredibly hard to do. But I'd like to throw my hat into the ring - this is the Email 2.0 specification.

> I must first preface this document with a note - this is a spec, not an implementation. Although I intend to try and build an implementation, it will probably be pretty rubbish. Also, this will not work unless there are many implementations of Email 2.0 - Ed
